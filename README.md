# In the report "The Bach Doodle: Approachable music composition with machine learning at scale," the development and deployment of Google's Bach Doodle are thoroughly examined. This web application employs the Coconet machine learning model to harmonize melodies submitted by users in the style of Johann Sebastian Bach, aiming to democratize the music composition process. The significant technological achievement detailed in this report involves adapting the Coonnet model for efficient browser use via TensorFlow.js, enhancing the app's performance to ensure a user-friendly experience where harmonization tasks are completed in just two seconds.This report is integral to understanding the Bach Doodle dataset, which consists of over 21.6 million harmonizations generated from user inputs. This dataset is invaluable for research in ethnomusicology, providing a unique lens through which to study global musical engagement and preferences. It not only showcases the practical application of machine learning in the arts but also serves as a resource for exploring user interaction with music technology, making it a pivotal study for my interest in the intersection of music, culture, and machine learning technologies.
